auto completion for docker with the BASH shell.

=== Try the official one instead? ===

https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/completion/bash/docker

I wrote this because I couldn't find the official one but also because
it was interesting.

But it turns out I can't get the official one to work very well. The
official ones uses the standard output of the commands and this one
uses the API. Maybe that makes a difference?


=== installation ===

For Amazon Linux, you need to install bash_completion first

{{{
yum --enablerepo=epel install bash-completion bash-completion-extras
}}}

* bash_completion

You first need the following dependencies:

* socat
** available in ubuntu with:

{{{
apt-get install socat
}}}

** available in Amazon Linux with:

{{{
yum install socat
}}}

* jq
** the indispensible jq program
** available in ubuntu with:

{{{
apt-get install jq
}}}

** available in Amazon Linux with:

{{{
yum install jq
}}}

* GNU Sed
** should be on all good unix systems

Then just pull this file and include it in your shell.

{{{
$ curl -o ~/.docker-complete https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicferrier/docker-bash-completion/master/docker-complete
$ source ~/.docker-complete
}}}

Of course, you could also add it to your {{{.bashrc}}}


Alternately, clone this repo on your boxes:

{{{
$ git clone https://github.com/nicferrier/docker-bash-completion.git
}}}

and then you can:

{{{
$ source docker-bash-completion/docker-complete
}}}


=== docker commands ===

This ac will complete docker sub-commands (ps, images, etc...) for
you. It does this automatically based on the docker help.

It won't do any further completion except in specific cases.

Example:

{{{
$ docker s[TAB]
save    search  start   stop    
$ docker se[TAB]
$ docker search 
}}}

=== docker kill ===

This ac will complete docker names for you (based on the short name
output by the {{{docker ps}}} command).

{{{
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES
aa571058142e        nicferrier/elnode:latest   /bin/sh -c '/usr/loc   4 hours ago         Up 4 hours          6001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   berserk_hoover
$ docker kill [TAB]
$ docker kill berserk_hoover
}}}

This was actually why I wrote it but because the output of {{{docker
ps}}} isn't parseable it's also this that requires the {{{socat}}} and
{{{jq}}} dependencies. Frustrating. All tools everywhere should always
provide parseable output and no, "you can use the API" isn't really an
excuse.

=== docker inspect, docker logs ===

Just do the same as {{{docker kill}}}

Short names only.
